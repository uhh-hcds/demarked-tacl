NGO Digital Gerwalt,https://www.aktiv-gegen-digitale-gewalt.de/de/digitale-gewalt.html,,,"Hatespeech is when people are publicly insulted, devalued or threatened online or when violence is incited. It also includes threats of rape and calls for suicide.

Such aggressive messages often come from a large number of people at the same time, usually in response to a specific post or article published online. This is often referred to as a hatestorm.","Cyberstalking
